A branding image, or an ad image, makes a great choice for the top of your sidebar.


Remember as you add text that the sidebar is quite narrow.


Thus, you should use short sentences.


And one-sentence paragraphs.


Make it easy to read.


(And be careful with bullets, because they can sometimes look awkward with sidebar spacing.)


Most importantly: send yourself test emails, and check in different email clients.


Itâ€™s the only way to truly know how your emails will appear once sent.
