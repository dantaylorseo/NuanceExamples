[firstname default=”Subscriber],


This is the opening to your email.


A best practice is to open with a short, easily digestible line, followed by a longer line.


Then feel free to bunch a few sentences together into a larger block of text, as done here. The reason to open your emails this way, instead of with all of this in one big paragraph, is to make it easy and inviting for your subscribers to build momentum reading your email. 


<h2>Most importantly: deliver on your promise!</h2>


Notice the subject line above?


You definitely want to make an irresistible promise so that your email gets opened. But you can’t just make the promise. Most important, you need to deliver on it.


High open rates are nice, but they don’t mean anything if people aren’t reading your emails and taking action on them. And the quickest way to get people to unsubscribe is by using a click-bait subject line and then underwhelming your subscribers when they read your email.


Your subject line is your bond. Keep your word with your content.


<h3>Always look for ways to improve readability</h3>


Remember that most people read your emails on their mobile devices. 


Mobile devices have small screens. And on small screens reading large, continuous blocks of text followed by large, continuous blocks of text can be a chore on the eyes. 


So break up your paragraphs. Two to three sentences max is a good rule of thumb.


Also consider using bullet points, which offer the following benefits:


<ul>
<li>Draw attention to a relevant list of items</li>
<li>Break up the monotonous flow of regular text</li>
<li>Offer the opportunity for parallelism and rhythm within your writing</li>
</ul> 
And if you want an ordered list (numbers instead of bullet points), replace the <code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code> tags with <code>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</code>.


Finally … don’t forget your email signature! This is an email, not a blog post. :-)


Your Name
Current Title
Company or Organization


P.S. Never underestimate the power of the P.S. section to drive home an important point you want to make sure stands point.


Would you believe that a lot of people will actually skim over your emails but then pay attention to the P.S. section? It’s true!


We like to reiterate the most important link or call to action in this section.
